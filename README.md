Numbers fall and the user must hit the right numbers as they pass the pink number row. The speed at which the numbers fall increases steadily. 
Score increases when the user hits the right number within 20 pixels of the number row.
Score does not increase when the user taps the number before or after the 20 pixel range.
The game is over when the number of misses, or lives, reaches zero.
